"""
Class to read Be-II signals, and detect ELMs.

The disruption time can be specified, in which case only ELMs before this time will be detected

Method used for ELM detection:

  -  Only use the Be-II signal up until the disruption time, if there is a disruption.
     This ensures that the filtering doesn't give us extra unwanted oscillations due
     to the large signal at the time of the disruption.
  -  Find the background using wavelet filtering (module wv_get_background).
  -  Find ELMs by studying the first derivative of the Be-II signal. We are looking for a positive derivative, followed by a negative derivative. Different thresholds can be set for the positive & negative derivative to account for the shape of the ELM signals (sharp rise, followed by shallower fall off).

Future improvements:
  - Finding the background using wavelets is a bit slow: try a moving average
  - a variable threshold. Sometimes the threshold is too low/high, resulting in incorrectly detected ELMs or missing ELMs.
